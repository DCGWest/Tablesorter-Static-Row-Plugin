Description:

    This widget allows you to mark any row(s) in the table as "static", thus ensuring that these rows
    remain in their starting position through any and all sorts.


Usage:

    1. Simply add the "staticRow" widget to the tablesorter() call as follows:
        $('#myElem').tablesorter({ widgets: ['staticRow'] });

    2. Add the class "static" to any and all rows that you wish to be unsortable.

    That's it!
